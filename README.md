# Hanneles Art Gallery

## Introduction

### Project Description

[Hanneles Art Gallery](https://hanneles-art-gallery-99fb21934da8.herokuapp.com/) is a fictional eCommerce website that offers original paintings to affordable prices. 
The painting images and descriptions are used with kind permission of Hannele Kaarlejärvi, the artist. 

The webshop includes a preview of all painings with links to a larger image and more detailed information. The images can also be viewed in full size. Paintings can be added to the shopping cart but as they are unique only a quantity of 1 can be added. In the shopping cart, paintings can be removed, or the user can proceed to the checkout page. For Payment purposes the website is connected with Stripe. Test purchases can be performed with [Stripes test cards](https://stripe.com/docs/testing/).
User can also register for an account where the order history is stored.  



### Business Model

Hanneles Art Gallery is a B2C (Business to Customer) business even though also businesses can purchase paintings. 
Target group are users who want to decorate their homes but want to avoid off-the-shelf-prints and instead look for real paintings. 


#### Phase 1 (in scope for this project)
Hanneles Art Gallery sells a limited range of paintings to fair conditions. 


#### Phase 2 (out of scope for this project)
An "Art Academy" will be launched including a membership area where interested users may find tutorials about how to start painting and what tools to use. Beginners level tutorials will be free of charge and a member fee will be charged for more advanced tutorials. 


#### Phase 3 (out of scope for this project)
The webshop will widen its scope and start selling high quality tools for painting. 


### Web Marketing Strategy

#### Target Audience
According to [Interior Design magazine](https://interiordesign.net/designwire/women-in-design-confronting-the-glass-ceiling/) around 70% of all Interior Designers in the US are women and also in private homes it's often the women who choose the interior decor. Furthermore, many women see painting as an opportunity for self-expression and stress-reduction. For that reason the main target audience of the webshop as well as for phase 2 and 3 are women. 

#### Facebook Business Page
In the start phase of the business we will concentrate on Facebook as Marketing platform. That way the artist can create a more personal relationship with followers and keep the communication ongoing by answering comments and questions online. This allows also to test different approaches and validation.

By the time of writing this ReadMe file (2024-01-30) the businesses [Facebook Page Hanneles Art Gallery](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61555624246656) has 5 Followers.

#### Newsletter
A monthly newsletter will be created using Mailchimp services. The newsletter will contain information about new paintings available in the shop but also act as "appetizer" as we will tell some background stories about the making of the paintings and the inspiration behind it. 
It will also include information about exhibitions and other events. 

Users can easily find and subsribe to the newsletter on the Home Page of Hanneles Art Gallery. Only an email address and password are necessary to subscribe. All administration will be handled [by Mailchimps services](https://mailchimp.com/).

### SEO - Search Engine Optimization
Prior to project start some brainstorming resultad in a number of short and long-tail keywords. Using three different browsers and a mobile, resulted in a couple of keyword volume and competition analysis results from [Wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/).
Also Google search with suggested search phrases as well as related searches was used. However, original paintings seem to be a niche product and Googles suggestions were not comprehensive. 
The selected keywords and long-tail phrases where included in meta description and keywords as well as in the headings and button texts.

#### sitemap.xml
To further improve searchability of the website a sitemap.xml file was included, using [XML Sitemaps.xml](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/).


#### robots.txt
The robots.txt file allowes crawl access to all parts of the website but the accounts and checkout pages.


#### Privacy Policy
To comply with GDPR a Privacy Policy has been created using the [Privacy Policy Generator](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/). The layout was adapted to the style of the webshop and added to the footer of the Home Page. However, I noticed that the English in the auto-generated file is quite bad but as it was suggested to use this website during the course I used it anyway.

### UX

As the webshop only sells paintings the focus in the design was on presenting the paintings. This was achieved with an overview page that allows for a good overview of all paintings (including filtering and sorting by price) and a large image of the painting when clicking on the "Click for details" button under each image. The user than can see a large image and can "study" the painting in detail before scrolling down to see short descriptions. As users usually don't buy a lot of paintings but take their time to choose one I concluded that a good picture is more important than size, format or price. 
The color scheme was chosen after the mostly female target group and is therefore in soft pinkish/lila colors, mixed with a darker nuance for better readability. 
Some of the images are unfortunately not well fotographed and have an ugly, lopsided frame around the actual painting but as I didn't had access to the original paintings to take new pictures I left it as it is.

- Include map and directions
- Add more information about the location
- Add customer review connectivity (Tripadvisor, Google, or similar)
- Add accommodation information & booking possibility
- Add more service providers
- Add live view & live weather conditions

## Typography and color scheme

The color scheme was selected to represent the prominent colors in nature: brown and green, which also harmonize very well with the images used on the site. These colors are often associated with warmth, comfort, and steadiness and are therefore well suited for a site that aims to attract people who seek recreation and nature experiences.

Typography was chosen because of its soft and rounded letters that reflect a more calm or even old-fashioned style but are easy readable.

## Browser Testing

Functionality, links, layout, and responsiveness were tested with the following browsers without any issues:

- Microsoft Edge Version 117.0.2045.47
- Firefox Version 118.0.1
- Brave Version 1.58.135
- Google Chrome Version 116.0.5845.188
  
## Device Testing

Functionality, links, layout, and responsiveness were tested on the following devices without any issues:

- Dell Laptop 14" / 1920px x 1080px
- HP Laptop 17" / 1920px x 1080px

- Samsung Galaxy 22S Ultra / 3088px x 1440px
- iPhone 8 / 1334px × 750px

### Findings under testing

- As users might want to receive information about more than one topic, checkboxes were initially used on the Contact us page. However, after some trials and Google research it turned out that this feature requires Javascript which was not part of the course so far.

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
- Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
